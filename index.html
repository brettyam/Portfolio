					<p class="slide2-text">Originally from the lands of Southern California, I am currently attending the University of Washington in pursuit of a degree in Informatics. My academic focus is on human-computer interaction, but what exactly does this entail you ask? Well, a lot! My skills range from designing a complete user experience, all the way down to writing every last line of functional computer code. I am currently looking to apply my knowledge, get my foot in the door, and see where my abilities can take me in the industry.</p>

									It was made for a fictional pizza company and serves as more of a testament to the
									web technology skills I have learned. User experience was not the main focus for 
									this piece but despite that, the site has seen many iterations and tweaks to make
									the overall navigation more comfortable. Available on the "Orders" page is a fully
									functional shopping cart using Javascript and AJAX. Feel free to play around with it!</p>

									<p class="proj-desc" id="desc2">For this project, I worked with team and took the role as the main developer. We built this site for a real client that wanted a place where her potential customers could get view the apartments that she was leasing. I worked very closely with the designers on my team to keep the UI clean and understandable. However, my main responsibility was to develop the templates for each page via HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as well as implement the Google Maps API.</p>

									<p class="proj-desc" id="desc3">In my "Design Thinking" class, we were required to work with a disabled client and design a speech-to-text application prototype. This required us really build user empathy through user research, interviews with our client, and iterating over several prototypes. This particular document is meant to simulated a design specification that would ideally be passed on to a team of engineers for development. As such, it is meant to be meticulous and thorough.</p>

									<p class="proj-desc" id="desc4">In this document, I walk you through my thought process over the ten week arc of designing Encaption. From high level UX decisions to the minute color of a simple UI button, I do my best to rationalize all of these choices in favor of the user, as well as give a little bit of my own commentary along the way. Also included are some user interview notes, personas I made, and several accounts of user testing.</p>

									<p class="proj-desc" id="desc5">For sprint #1 of my Mobile App Design class, we were required to come up with several "design languages" that we could potentially use to build an entire operating system off of. This entailed heavy user research, discussions of what we ourselves wanted in a phone, and hours of sketching and wireframing. Here are samples of the design languages we came up with, though note that we decided on "Bubble" to bring the remainder of the project into fruition.</p>

									<p class="proj-desc" id="desc6">More recently I have began to take an interest in designing for mobile devices. For this particular piece, our class aimed to design an entire mobile OS that we called "Bubble" and my team was responsible for the media player. Designing in an Agile environment, we were required to have a daily scrum meeting to keep the group focus on track as well as come up with exit goals for the end of each sprint. Here are some of the wireframes for our design.</p>
